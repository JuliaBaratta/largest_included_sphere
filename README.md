# largest_included_sphere
Babe, wakeup someone put a largest included sphere in my porous material 

Instructions: 
1. put this .py script in the same location as a .cif file
2. read in the file and it will spit out file_with_void.cif which is that same strucutre + an 'X' grey element in the most void spot in the structure
3. You can then visualize this in Vesta and change the 'x' atom color and size with Objects > Properties > Atoms > Radius and Color
4. Change this to your desired color (yellow recommended) and LCD if you know it (otherwise just increase the radius until sufficiently large)

note: 'x' specifications will not be saved changes, if you figure that out lmk
